# School District Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis 

### Purpose

###### The purpose of Module Four and the School District Analysis Challenge is to gain additional practice using Python and introducing Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, the Pandas library, and NumPy into my analysis.  One of the most important concepts covered in Module Four and the School District Analysis Challenge is how to create and manipulate DataFrames by reading external CSV files, using Pandas loc method, using Pandas groupby function, and creating bins to name a few.  This allowed me to thoroughly analyze school data for up to fifteen different high schools across four different grade levels.  Also I was able to identify average math, reading, and overall scores and passing rates by per student budget, by school size, and by school type.  The challenge requires to ...

### Results

- **How is the district summary affected?**  Overall, after setting the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders to NaN (aka not a number), and essentially removing these the 461 entries from the district summary calculations, the district summary was minimally affected.  When Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing are rounded to zero decimal places in the district summary, no change is detected.  The district summaries remain unchanged from initial calculations when all fifteen different high schools across four different grade levels are considered versus when Thomas High School math and reading grades are removed for ninth graders only.
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  - Math and reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

### Summary: 

###### Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
